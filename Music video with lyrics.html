</p>Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael<br>
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you<br>
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload<br>
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos<br>
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael<br>
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you<br>
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload<br>
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though<br>  
    

</p>You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy<br>
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy<br>
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy<br>
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy<br>
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy<br>
30 for a walk through, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy<br>
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip<br>
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'<br>
And I'm like "Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold"<br>
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked<br>
I got homies, let it go, oh<br>
My money thick, won't ever fold<br>
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"<br>
And I can't ever tell you no<br>

<p><b>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</b><br><br>

</p>The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy<br>
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies<br>
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky<br>
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch<br>
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top<br>
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top<br>
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (hey)<br>
Uh, take you to the smoke shop<br>
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo<br>
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Picov<br>
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums<br>
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright<br>
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though<br>
All VVSs, put you in a necklace<br>
Girl, you look beautiful tonight<br>
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry<br>
