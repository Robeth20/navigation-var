Yeah<br>

<span style ="background-color:black;>It's 3 AM, answer your phone<br>
I know you hate to be alone <br>
Say you been waitin' on me all night<br>
I'll let you stay, you play your cards right<br>
It's 3 AM, answer your phone<br>

I know you up, I know you down<br>
I live alone, so let's get loud<br>
You from the BX like JLo<br>
I fuck with you 'cause you lay low<br>
Pussy be rainin', ass is thunder clappin', mouth's a tornado<br>
This just the calm before the storm<br>
It's three o'clock in the morn'<br>
I like a freak, had to ask, "When we droppin' the porn?"<br>
Baby, chill that's just for me and you<br>
You needin' me, I'm needin' you<br>
Pick up, pull up, pick up, pull up, please<br> </p>
   
   <p style= "color:yellow; font-family:'Courier New'">
 It's 3 AM, answer your phone<br>
I know you hate to be alone<br>
Say you been waitin' on me all night<br>
I'll let you stay, you play your cards right<br>
It's 3 AM, answer your phone<br>
I know you hate to be alone<br>
Say you been waiting on me all night<br>
I'll let you stay, you play your cards right<br> </p>
       
    <p style= "color:yellow; font-family:'Courier New'">
Told you if you play your cards right<br>
I wouldn't usually but I might let you stay the night<br>
It's something different 'bout you, I might need it one more time<br>
Got me thinkin' 'bout you, baby, you been on my mind<br>
Yeah, you been on my mind<br>
Don't wanna leave you waitin'<br>
But if I do, I'll make it up to you girl<br>
I need you to wait for me <br> </p>
       
    <p style= "color:yellow; font-family:'Courier New'">
It's 3 AM, answer your phone<br>
I know you hate to be alone<br>
Say you been waitin' on me all night (all night)<br>
I'll let you stay, you play your cards right <br> </p>
       
   <p style= "color:yellow; font-family:'Courier New'">
Call me once, call me twice<br>
I'm, out my mind, back in five<br>
I don't know why, tryna fight<br>
I can't deny<br>
I've been running 'round thinkin' 'bout you all day<br>
I've been dodging texts, playin' cool all day<br>
Waiting on me, you said it's gettin' late<br>
In and out of sleep, you're tryna stay awake<br> </p>
       
    <p style= "color:yellow; font-family:'Courier New'">
 It's 3 AM, answer your phone<br>
I know you hate to be alone<br>
Say you been waitin' on me all night<br>
I'll let you stay, you play your cards right<br>
